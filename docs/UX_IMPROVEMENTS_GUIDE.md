## Key Benefits

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Before:** All sections had equal visual weight
- **After:** Clear hierarchy with main workflow prominent

### Screen Real Estate
- **Before:** Templates and import took up ~40% of screen space
- **After:** Main expectation builder gets ~80% of focus

### User Flow
- **Before:** Users had to scroll through all options
- **After:** Progressive disclosure - show what's needed when needed

### Cognitive Load
- **Before:** All options visible simultaneously
- **After:** Focused interface with advanced features accessible but not overwhelming

## Implementation Notes

### Session State Variables
```python
# New variables added
st.session_state.show_sql_popup = False
st.session_state.show_import_popup = False
```

### Component Structure
```python
def render(self, data):
    self._render_suite_management()      # Dataset info
    self._render_quick_actions(data)     # Import + Templates
    self._render_expectation_builder(data) # Main workflow
    self._render_current_expectations()   # Summary + Management
    self._render_navigation_buttons()     # Navigation
    # Popups rendered conditionally
    if st.session_state.show_sql_popup:
        self._render_sql_popup(data)
```

### User Experience Principles Applied

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show advanced features only when needed
2. **Information Hierarchy**: Most important actions are most prominent
3. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Fewer visible options at any time
4. **Consistent Interaction Patterns**: Buttons for actions, expanders for details
5. **Clear Visual Separation**: Distinct sections with clear boundaries

## Testing

The improvements have been tested with:
- ✅ Component initialization
- ✅ Template application
- ✅ Expectation config building
- ✅ Import processing
- ✅ Session state management

All tests pass successfully, confirming the improvements work as intended.
